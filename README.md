Enhanced Steganography Security with BES Algorithm and Chaotic Encryption

This project introduces a novel solution to augment the security of steganography, a technique for concealing confidential data within images. The proposed approach combines optimal pixel selection through the Bald Eagle Search (BES) algorithm with chaotic encryption to address contemporary challenges such as data exposure and vulnerabilities in current methods.

Key Features:
Bald Eagle Search (BES) Algorithm: Utilizes strategic exploration to identify optimal spots for data concealment, enhancing the effectiveness of steganography.
Chaotic Encryption: Adds unpredictability to the embedding process, fortifying the method against potential threats.
BESOPS-CE Technique: Integrates the BES algorithm's selection process with chaotic encryption, employing three distinct strategies (selecting space, searching, and swooping) to pinpoint optimal locations for embedding secret data.

By combining these techniques, the project aims to significantly enhance the overall security of steganography in today's evolving digital landscape.
